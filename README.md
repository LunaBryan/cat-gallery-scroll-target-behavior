# Cat-gallery-scroll-target-behavior
The ScrollTargetBehavior in SwiftUI is an enumeration that defines how a scroll view should behave when scrolling to a specific target. It allows developers to specify the scrolling behavior, such as whether the target should be aligned to the top, center, or bottom of the scroll view.

When to Use It?
You would use ScrollTargetBehavior when you want to control the alignment of a target view within a scroll view, especially when implementing features like navigation or focusing on specific content.
